These are some of the projects we had in one of our classes in 4th Semester. They should all compile, i had to manually remove some private keys from the codebase which is why the IOT project might actually not build.

The servers we tested these on were provided by our professor and should be down already, making most of them not working.

Sadly the code quality is pretty bad, since we had very little time for each project and the focus was set on "making it work" instead of "making it pretty".
